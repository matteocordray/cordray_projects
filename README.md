# Matteo's Embedded Systems Projects
This repository serves to showcase my top embedded systems projects I've worked on in the past four years.

For the structure of this repo, the `projects` folder serves to host the projects themselves, while the `docs` folder serves to host the documentation for the projects.

There are four projects in this repo:
- [**`Sprinter Van Control System Project`**](projects/sprinter_van_project/): This project started off as a simple side gig and turned into a learning opportunity for me within the BLE and automotive space. The project is a control system for a 2016 Mercedes Sprinter Van that allows for remote control of the vehicle's blinds, lights, and A/C. The project is currently in the process of being developed and is not yet complete, but this folder details the progress I've made so far.
- [**`Verilog AES Encryption Project`**](projects/verilog_encryption_project/): This project is a simple implementation of the AES encryption algorithm in Verilog. The project is currently in the process of being developed and is not yet complete, but this folder details the current state of the project.
- [**`Autonomous MMP-5 Robot`**](projects/autonomous_mmp5_robot/): This project is a simple autonomous robot that is capable of navigating a course and identifying targets. The project is completed and this folder details the final state of the project.
- [**`Python Quadruped Simulator`**](projects/quadruped_simulator/): This project was intended to help simulate a four-legged robot in Python. The project uses pybullet, a physics engine, to simulate the robot. I simulated the walking gait that was implemented as well as the balancing. Few tests were done to qualitatively compare the simulation from the . The project is completed and this folder details the final state of the project.
