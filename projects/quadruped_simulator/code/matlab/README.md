# Quadruped Simulator - Matlab

This folder contains the scripts for running the simulation in Matlab. The `main.py` script runs to output text to `output.txt`. You can then run the `sarge5_plot.m` script to plot the data.
- `sarge5_plot.m` - Used to plot the data from `output.txt`
- `output.txt` - Used to output data with PID control
- `output_no_pid.txt` - Used to output data without PID control
