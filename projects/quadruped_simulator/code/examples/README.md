# Quadruped Simulator - Examples

This folder contains a few examples of the quadruped simulator. The examples are:

- `pybullet_inverse_k_example.py`: This file contains the code for some example inverse kinematics straight from the pybullet documentation. It is not used in the main simulation.
- `pybullet_robot_dog_example.py`: This file contains the code for a similiar quadruped robot from the pybullet documentation. It is not used in the main simulation. However, it helped understand some of the principles used in the main simulation.
